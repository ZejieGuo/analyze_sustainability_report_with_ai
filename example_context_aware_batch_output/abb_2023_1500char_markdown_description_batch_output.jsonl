It is structured around two main themes: the achievement of a low-carbon society and the preservation of resources, reflecting ABB's commitment to a sustainable future.\n\nKey data points include:\n\n1. **Low-Carbon Society**: ABB aims to significantly reduce its carbon emissions. By 2030, it plans to cut its own scope 1 and scope 2 CO2e emissions by at least 80% from a 2019 baseline of 636 kilotons CO2e. As of 2023, emissions have been reduced to 151 kilotons CO2e. For scope 3 emissions, the target is a 25% reduction by 2030, starting from 76,834.2 kilotons CO2e in 2022, with the current status showing a mild decrease to 76,665.2 kilotons CO2e. Additionally, there's an ambition to avoid 600 megatons CO2e through the lifetime of products sold between 2022 and 2030, with 74 megatons CO2e avoided so far.\n\n2. **Preserving Resources**: Efforts to integrate circularity into 80% of ABB's product portfolio by 2030 are underway, with 31% achieved as of 2023. The company has also made strides in waste management, reducing waste sent to landfill, equivalent to 6.3% of total waste down from 8.8% in 2019. Finally, there's a commitment to maintaining zero harm in the workplace, aiming to cut lost time from incidents to 0.13, down from a baseline of 0.24 in 2019.\n\nThe context from the sustainability report underscores ABB's strategic focus on electrification, automation, and digitalization to drive the energy transition. The initiatives are part of a broader effort to foster resource efficiency and social progress through the ABB Way operational model.\n\n```markdown\n| Targets                                                                                  | Baseline (baseline year)                                 | 2023 status                                           |\n|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------|\n| **LOW-CARBON SOCIETY**                                                                   |                                                          |                                                       |\n| Reduce own scope 1 and 2 CO2e emissions by at least 80% by 2030 and by 100% by 2050      | 636 kilotons CO2e (adjusted for portfolio changes) 2019  | 151 kilotons CO2e                                     |\n| Reduce scope 3 CO2e emissions by 25% by 2030 and                                         | 76,834.2 kilotons CO2e (2022)                            | 76,665.2 kilotons CO2e                                |\n| by 90% by 2050                                                                           | 392,188 kilotons CO2e (2022)                             | 436,346.3 kilotons CO2e                               |\n| Ambition to avoid 600 megatons CO2e emissions throughout lifetime of products sold       | 65 megatons CO2e (2022)                                  | 74 megatons CO2e                                      |\n| from 2022 to 2030                                                                        |                                                          |                                                       |\n| **PRESERVING RESOURCES**                                                                 |                                                          |                                                       |\n| Cover at least 80% of ABB\u2019s portfolio of products and solutions with our Circularity Approach by 2030 | na.                                                      | 31% (share of ABB\u2019s products and solutions assessed)  |\n| Send zero waste to landfill while reducing waste generation by 2030                      | 16.8 kilotons (2019), equivalent to 8.8% of total waste   | 10.1 kilotons, equivalent to 6.3% of total waste     |\n| Zero harm to our people and contractors \u2014 we aim for a gradual reduction in lost time from incidents | 0.24 (2019)                                              | 0.13                                                  |\n```\n", "refusal": null}, "logprobs": null, "finish_reason": "stop"}], "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 2498, "completion_tokens": 838, "total_tokens": 3336, "prompt_tokens_details": {"cached_tokens": 0, "audio_tokens": 0}, "completion_tokens_details": {"reasoning_tokens": 0, "audio_tokens": 0, "accepted_prediction_tokens": 0, "rejected_prediction_tokens": 0}}, "system_fingerprint": "fp_159d8341cc"}}, "error": null}

It focuses on three main aspects of sustainability goals: Trust KPI, Engagement KPI, and supply chain management.\n\n1. **Trust KPI**: This metric shows the percentage of reporters who disclosed their identity during severity level 1 and 2 investigations. The data indicates a steady rate of reporter disclosure, with 57% in 2021, which increased to and maintained at 60% in 2022 and 2023. This suggests an improvement in the transparency and trust within the organization over the years.\n\n2. **Engagement KPI**: This KPI measures the engagement levels of employees with the Integrity Awareness Portal (IAP). Starting at 25% of employees in 2021, engagement significantly increased to 69% in 2022 and reached 80% by the end of 2023. This marks a positive trend in employee involvement in integrity learnings, highlighting the effectiveness of the organization's engagement strategies.\n\n3. **Supply Chain Management**: The table also outlines the progress toward a significant target concerning high-risk suppliers in focus countries. The organization aims to cover at least 80% of its supply spending on high-risk suppliers under the Sustainable Supply Base Management (SSBM) by 2025. As of 2023, the coverage is at 42%, indicating substantial progress but also highlighting the journey ahead to meet the 2025 target.\n\nThis table is set within the broader context of the sustainability report, which discusses ABB's ambitious goals related to low-carbon initiatives, resource conservation, and social progress.

This data is structured into two primary categories: by region and by gender, and further split into the types of employment\u2014total, permanent, and temporary. \n\nIn 2023, the total number of employees was highlighted to show a slight increase compared to 2022, indicating potentially strategic growth or expansion in workforce size. Specifically, the total number of employees grew from 106,850 in 2022 to 110,442 in 2023. The regional breakdown shows that most employees are situated in Europe, followed by Asia, the Middle East, Africa, and The Americas. There is a notable increase in the total number of employees across all regions in 2023.\n\nWhen examining gender distribution, males constitute the majority of ABB's workforce, although there is also an increase in female employees, which aligns with trends of increasing gender parity in STEM fields. The data also categorizes employees as either permanent or temporary, with the majority being permanent employees, highlighting stability within the workforce. There are missing values for 2022 data in some subcategories, indicating possible issues with data collection or reporting changes.\n\nThis detailed breakdown emphasizes ABB's commitment to tracking its workforce demographic and regional distribution, reflecting the company's interest in maintaining an informed strategy for human resource management and sustainability reporting.\n\n```markdown\n| Indicator Description                          | 2023     | 2022     |\n|------------------------------------------------|----------|----------|\n| **NUMBER OF EMPLOYEES (REFLECTED IN HEADCOUNT)**|          |          |\n| **Total Number of Employees by Region**        |          |          |\n| Europe                                         | 52,723   | 51,360   |\n| The Americas                                   | 26,437   | 25,950   |\n| Asia, Middle East and Africa                   | 31,282   | 29,540   |\n| **Total Number of Employees by Gender**        |          |          |\n| Female                                         | 30,644   | 29,900   |\n| Male                                           | 79,798   | 76,950   |\n| Total number of employees                      | 110,442  | 106,850  |\n| **NUMBER OF PERMANENT EMPLOYEES**              |          |          |\n| **Total Number of Permanent Employees by Region**|        |          |\n| Europe                                         | 48,224   | na.      |\n| The Americas                                   | 26,184   | na.      |\n| Asia, Middle East and Africa                   | 29,618   |          |\n| **Total Number of Permanent Employees by Gender**|        |          |\n| Female                                         | 28,825   |          |\n| Male                                           | 75,201   | na.      |\n| Total number of permanent employees            | 104,026  | na.      |\n| **NUMBER OF TEMPORARY EMPLOYEES**              |          |          |\n| **Total Number of Temporary Employees by Region**|        |          |\n| Europe                                         | 4,499    | na.      |\n| The Americas                                   | 253      | na.      |\n| Asia, Middle East and Africa                   | 1,664    |          |\n```\n", "refusal": null}, "logprobs": null, "finish_reason": "stop"}], "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 2106, "completion_tokens": 690, "total_tokens": 2796, "prompt_tokens_details": {"cached_tokens": 0, "audio_tokens": 0}, "completion_tokens_details": {"reasoning_tokens": 0, "audio_tokens": 0, "accepted_prediction_tokens": 0, "rejected_prediction_tokens": 0}}, "system_fingerprint": "fp_159d8341cc"}}, "error": null}

This data is crucial for understanding ABB's workforce dynamics and safety performance. The table illustrates employee turnover and hiring by region and gender, and also documents work-related injuries including fatal incidents.\n\nFrom the provided figures, we can observe regional and gender-based distribution in employment changes from 2022 to 2023. Key trends include a noticeable increase in employee turnover percentages especially in regions like the Americas, where turnover rose from 19% to 22%. Also evident is the stability in male turnover, staying constant at 15% from one year to the next, while female turnover saw a slight increase.\n\nIn terms of employee hires, there's a decline noted in all regions from 2022 to 2023, suggesting a cautious hiring strategy after an initially high intake. Furthermore, the number of hires also saw a distinct decrease between the genders, highlighting changes in recruitment focus or success.\n\nThe report addresses safety performance, with no work-related fatalities reported for both years, a positive yet pivotal indicator of their ongoing commitment to employee safety. The one business travel-related fatality in 2023, compared to none the previous year, might suggest areas needing further analysis and action.\n\nOverall, this detailed table provides insight into ABB's human resource management and safety strategies, which are informative for stakeholders concerned with corporate social responsibility and employee welfare.\n\n```markdown\n| Category                                       | 2022 Headcount and (%) | 2023 Headcount and (%) |\n|------------------------------------------------|------------------------|------------------------|\n| **Employee Turnover**                          |                        |                        |\n| Turnover of All Employees by Region            |                        |                        |\n| Europe                                         | 6,852 (13%)            | 7,032 (14%)            |\n| The Americas                                   | 5,107 (19%)            | 5,726 (22%)            |\n| Asia, Middle East and Africa                   | 4,472 (14%)            | 4,438 (15%)            |\n| Turnover of All Employees by Gender            |                        |                        |\n| Female                                         | 4,817 (16%)            | 5,375 (18%)            |\n| Male                                           | 11,614 (15%)           | 11,821 (15%)           |\n| **Total Employee Turnover: ABB Group**         | 16,431 (15%)           | 17,196 (16%)           |\n|                                                |                        |                        |\n| **Employee Hires**                             |                        |                        |\n| Employee Hires by Region                       |                        |                        |\n| Europe                                         | 7,909 (15%)            | 6,068 (12%)            |\n| The Americas                                   | 6,543 (25%)            | 4,466 (17%)            |\n| Asia, Middle East and Africa                   | 5,783 (18%)            | 5,087 (17%)            |\n| Employee Hires by Gender                       |                        |                        |\n| Female                                         | 6,047 (20%)            | 4,983 (17%)            |\n| Male                                           | 14,188 (18%)           | 10,638 (14%)           |\n| **Total Employee Hires: ABB Group**            | 20,235 (18%)           | 15,621 (15%)           |\n|                                                |                        |                        |\n| **Work-Related Injuries**                      |                        |                        |\n| Employee Work-Related Fatalities               | 0                      | 0                      |\n| Incident Rate                                  | Not listed             | Not listed             |\n| Employee Business Travel Fatalities            | 0                      | 1                      |\n| Incident Rate                                  | Not listed             | 0.001                  |\n```\n", "refusal": null}, "logprobs": null, "finish_reason": "stop"}], "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 2140, "completion_tokens": 786, "total_tokens": 2926, "prompt_tokens_details": {"cached_tokens": 0, "audio_tokens": 0}, "completion_tokens_details": {"reasoning_tokens": 0, "audio_tokens": 0, "accepted_prediction_tokens": 0, "rejected_prediction_tokens": 0}}, "system_fingerprint": "fp_159d8341cc"}}, "error": null}

It is specifically focused on the reporting of hazards and the average hours of training provided to employees. Here are the main insights from the table:\n\n- **Hazards Reported and Reporting Rate:** The number of hazards reported has decreased slightly from 256,513 in 2022 to 250,741 in 2023. Correspondingly, the hazards reporting rate has also decreased marginally from 2.23 in 2022 to 2.18 in 2023. This metric provides insight into the organization's safety culture and the effectiveness of its incident reporting systems.\n\n- **Average Hours of Training per Year per Employee:** Although the specific values for average training hours in 2022 and 2023 are missing from the table, this metric is important for understanding the organization's commitment to employee development and maintaining a skilled workforce. It is worth noting from the full text provided that average training hours per employee, especially by gender, are listed separately, indicating a broader focus on training programs that may not be captured in this specific section.\n\nIn the broader context of the sustainability report, these metrics would highlight ABB's efforts to maintain safety in the workplace while ensuring continuous learning and development opportunities for its employees. The decrease in hazards reported might indicate improved safety measures, but it would be prudent to investigate whether there have been changes in the reporting procedures or criteria.\n\n```markdown\n| Metric                                   | 2022      | 2023      |\n|------------------------------------------|-----------|-----------|\n| Hazards reported?                        | 256,513   | 250,741   |\n| Hazards reporting rate2\u00ae                 | 2.23      | 2.18      |\n| AVERAGE HOURS OF TRAINING PER YEAR PER EMPLOYEE |           |           |\n```\n\nIn summary, the table sheds light on the performance of ABB in terms of workplace safety and employee training, which are critical components of its sustainability initiatives.", "refusal": null}, "logprobs": null, "finish_reason": "stop"}], "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 1329, "completion_tokens": 411, "total_tokens": 1740, "prompt_tokens_details": {"cached_tokens": 0, "audio_tokens": 0}, "completion_tokens_details": {"reasoning_tokens": 0, "audio_tokens": 0, "accepted_prediction_tokens": 0, "rejected_prediction_tokens": 0}}, "system_fingerprint": "fp_159d8341cc"}}, "error": null}

The data offers a comparison mainly between the years 2023 and 2022, highlighting percentages of employees in different categories and genders receiving regular performance and career development reviews. There are also figures on incidents of discrimination and harassment, as well as the company's stance on political contributions.\n\nKey Data Points and Trends:\n- In 2023, 100% of top and senior managers received regular performance reviews, which is a 2% improvement compared to 2022.\n- 99% of middle and lower managers received performance reviews in 2023, which is an increase of 4% from the previous year.\n- There was a significant increase in the percentage of other employees receiving reviews, rising from 85% in 2022 to 98% in 2023.\n- When reviewing performance metrics by gender in 2023, 64% of female and 69% of male employees received performance reviews. However, there\u2019s no data available for gender-specific reviews in 2022.\n- The total workforce receiving performance reviews decreased from 92% in 2022 to 68% in 2023.\n- There were 17 reported incidents of discrimination and 72 incidents of harassment in 2023, which show increases from 10 and 64 respectively in 2022.\n- The company reported making no financial or in-kind political contributions in either 2023 or the previously reported period.\n\nThrough these KPIs, we see a broader commitment to providing more comprehensive performance evaluations across different employee categories. However, it appears there is a decline in coverage when viewed as an aggregate of the total workforce, particularly when divided by gender. Additionally, there is an apparent commitment to maintaining political neutrality through zero contributions, which might be indicative of a strategy focused on minimizing potential external influences. The rise in reported incidents may prompt further investigation or initiatives to improve workplace environments.\n\n```markdown\n| Indicator Description                                         | Limited Assurance 2023 | 2023 | 2022 |\n|---------------------------------------------------------------|------------------------|------|------|\n| **PERCENTAGE OF EMPLOYEES RECEIVING REGULAR PERFORMANCE**     |                        |      |      |\n| **AND CAREER DEVELOPMENT REVIEWS BY EMPLOYEE CATEGORY**       |                        |      |      |\n| Top and senior managers                                       |                        | 100% | 98%  |\n| Middle and lower managers                                     |                        | 99%  | 95%  |\n| Other employees                                               |                        | 98%  | 85%  |\n| **PERCENTAGE OF EMPLOYEES RECEIVING REGULAR PERFORMANCE**     |                        |      |      |\n| **AND CAREER DEVELOPMENT REVIEWS BY GENDER**                  |                        |      |      |\n| Female                                                        |                        | 64%  | n.a. |\n| Male                                                          |                        | 69%  | n.a. |\n| Total workforce                                               |                        | 68%  | 92%  |\n| **INCIDENTS OF DISCRIMINATION AND CORRECTIVE ACTIONS TAKEN**  |                        |      |      |\n| Total number of incidents of discrimination                   |                        | 17   | 10   |\n| Total number of incidents of harassment                       |                        | 72   | 64   |\n| **POLITICAL CONTRIBUTIONS**                                   |                        |      |      |\n| Financial and in-kind political contributions                 |                        | 0    | 0    |\n```\n", "refusal": null}, "logprobs": null, "finish_reason": "stop"}], "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 2231, "completion_tokens": 734, "total_tokens": 2965, "prompt_tokens_details": {"cached_tokens": 0, "audio_tokens": 0}, "completion_tokens_details": {"reasoning_tokens": 0, "audio_tokens": 0, "accepted_prediction_tokens": 0, "rejected_prediction_tokens": 0}}, "system_fingerprint": "fp_159d8341cc"}}, "error": null}

It focuses on two key disclosures: the process to determine remuneration and the annual total compensation ratio. The table includes details on where these disclosures can be found, any omitted requirements as per ABB's internal guidelines, reasons for omissions, and explanations for missing or incomplete data.\n\nKey Points:\n- **Process to Determine Remuneration:** This is disclosed in the \"Compensation Report 2023.\" There are no specific omissions or explanation notes attached, signifying full disclosure in this area.\n\n- **Annual Total Compensation Ratio:** This disclosure also refers to the \"Compensation Report 2023.\" It highlights an omission under requirement 'b', which suggests reporting the percentage increase in compensation for the highest-paid individual compared to the median increase for all other employees. This information is unavailable because the ratio was not calculated at the time of the report. The explanation indicates that this will be addressed in the 2024 report, reflecting a forward-looking commitment to improving reporting transparency.\n\nThis table highlights ABB's ongoing efforts to improve reporting accuracy and fulfill compliance standards while acknowledging current gaps and setting future goals.\n\n```markdown\n| Disclosure                     | Location                    | ABB Requirement(s) omitted                                                                                                         | Omission Statements Reason                 | Explanation                                                                                                                                      |\n|--------------------------------|-----------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Process to determine remuneration | + Compensation Report 2023  |                                                                                                                                    |                                           |                                                                                                                                                  |\n| Annual total compensation ratio| + Compensation Report 2023  | b. report the ratio of the percentage increase in annual total compensation for the organization's highest-paid individual to the median percentage increase in annual total compensation for all employees (excluding the highest-paid individual)  | Information unavailable/ incomplete      | We didn\u2019t calculate the ratio prior to the disclosure in the 2023 report, therefore we cannot report on the percentage increase of the ratio.

Specifically, it highlights the requirement for disclosure regarding financial assistance received from governments and the management of material topics.\n\n- **Financial Assistance Received from Government (Requirement 01-4)**: The requirement specifies a detailed breakdown of financial assistance such as tax relief, subsidies, grants, awards, royalty holidays, financial incentives, and more. However, ABB has marked this disclosure as \"Not applicable\" due to the financial assistance not being material enough to warrant disclosure. There is a clarification that the assistance, if material, would require disclosure, but it currently does not apply to ABB. ABB also mentions that there is no obligation to disclose assistance by country, which aligns with their non-disclosure.\n\n- **Management of Material Topics (Requirement 3)**: This requirement references the ABB Financial Report 2023 under the management overview section. The table lacks specific details on this point likely because there's no additional explanation provided in the excerpt.\n\nThe table suggests ABB's discretion in sustainability reporting, indicating areas where disclosures are not made due to immateriality or confidentiality constraints.

Given the lack of numerical data and a classic 'rows and columns' format associated with tables, this information is best categorized as a narrative rather than a structured table or chart. It explains ABB's strategy in managing local employment and regulatory requirements without maintaining centralized aggregated reports due to confidentiality and compliance reasons.\n\nThis content outlines ABB's compliance framework, detailing the decentralized responsibility for regulatory adherence, which falls on respective local HR units, compliance, and employment law groups. ABB operates under the premise that unless legally required, it won't centralize local employment reporting at a global level, highlighting a strategic choice influenced by the volume of distinct regulatory requirements managed locally.\n\nNo numerical or structured data has been provided to suggest a traditional markdown table conversion. Rather, this text communicates ABB's methodological approach and confidentiality protocols in handling local employment compliance.\n\n**Key Highlights:**\n- ABB operates in over 90 countries requiring adherence to local employment laws and regulatory standards.\n- Responsibilities for ensuring compliance lie with respective local HR, employment law, and compliance teams.\n- Centralized reporting at the Global Corporate level is not maintained unless required by law, due to numerous local regulatory requirements.\n\nGiven the explanation within the text, here is the descriptive narrative presented in markdown:\n\n```markdown\n| Context                                                   | Key Points                                                                                                                                                                 |\n|-----------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| ABB's Global Operations and Compliance                    | - Operating in over 90 countries adhering to local employment laws, regulations, and standards.                                                                            |\n| Local Responsibility and Compliance Management            | - Local HR and compliance teams ensure adherence to each country's employment laws without mandating centralized global reporting unless required by law.                  |\n| Strategic Reporting Decisions                             | - Thousands of local requirements are maintained at the local level, avoiding unnecessary aggregation at a global level due to confidentiality and the practicality of local compliance. |\n\n```\n", "refusal": null}, "logprobs": null, "finish_reason": "stop"}], "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 1177, "completion_tokens": 395, "total_tokens": 1572, "prompt_tokens_details": {"cached_tokens": 0, "audio_tokens": 0}, "completion_tokens_details": {"reasoning_tokens": 0, "audio_tokens": 0, "accepted_prediction_tokens": 0, "rejected_prediction_tokens": 0}}, "system_fingerprint": "fp_159d8341cc"}}, "error": null}

It provides a framework for understanding ABB's regulatory approach in two primary areas: legal actions related to anti-competitive behavior and the company's tax policy and governance.\n\nKey sections include:\n- **Legal Actions for Anti-Competitive Behavior (206-1):** This section addresses legal actions related to anti-competitive behavior, with mention of any pending or completed legal matters. Importantly, details are kept confidential unless disclosure is mandated by legal authorities, highlighting ABB's commitment to maintain confidentiality and protect strategic sensitivities during ongoing legal processes.\n  \n- **Tax Topics (TAX, 3-3, 207-1 to 207-3):** These entries emphasize ABB's management of tax-related issues, including adherence to its tax policy, governance, risk management, and stakeholder engagement concerning tax matters. ABB\u2019s comprehensive approach to tax is encapsulated with reference to the \"ABB Tax Policy,\" indicating structured strategies around tax governance and risk management. Notably, specific details are often omitted for confidentiality reasons unless legally required.\n\nThe table suggests a careful balance ABB strikes between transparency, confidentiality, and legal/regulatory compliance. ABB's systematic approach demonstrates a strategic alignment with compliance while safeguarding sensitive corporate information.\n\n```markdown\n| Code   | Description                                                                                                                   | Reference        | Additional Information                                                                                                                                                                                   | Confidentiality Constraints                                                                                           |\n|--------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| 206-1  | Legal actions for anti-competitive behavior, anti-trust, and monopoly practices                                                |                  | a.

This table is essential for understanding the transparency and decision-making process ABB follows regarding its sustainability reporting.\n\nThe table highlights the complexity and sensitivity of global operations, displaying that not all data can be or is required to be aggregated at a global level. There are several instances noted where information is withheld due to confidentiality constraints, legal privilege, or lack of materiality at the Group level. \n\nKey points from the table:\n- ABB has not disclosed certain data related to government due to its insignificance to the organization.\n- Some data, like the proportion of senior management, is being considered for future collection and potential reporting.\n- Various legal, confidentiality, and data sensitivity concerns lead to the non-disclosure of specific commercial details.\n- There is a sustained effort from ABB to evaluate these omissions continuously as regulatory and operational frameworks evolve.\n\nThe content signifies ABB's approach to balancing compliance, confidentiality, and materiality in its global operations.\n\n```markdown\n| Requirement(s) omitted | Reason                             | Explanation                                                                                          |\n|------------------------|------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Government disclosures | Not material to ABB                | The requirement is deemed not significant enough to be disclosed for ABB's operations.               |\n| HR regional split data | Not consolidated at Group level    | Due to the high volume of country requirements, storing all at corporate level is not required.      |\n| Reporting on senior management proportions | Not reported globally  | While not currently collected, ABB is assessing the feasibility of tracking this information.         |\n| Energy consumption breakdown | Not distinctly categorized   | The requirement to separate energy types is evaluated as non-essential per the ABB Circularity framework. |\n| Tax information by country | Confidentiality constraints     | Sensitive commercial data is protected to maintain confidentiality and legal privilege.              |\n```\n", "refusal": null}, "logprobs": null, "finish_reason": "stop"}], "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 1327, "completion_tokens": 409, "total_tokens": 1736, "prompt_tokens_details": {"cached_tokens": 0, "audio_tokens": 0}, "completion_tokens_details": {"reasoning_tokens": 0, "audio_tokens": 0, "accepted_prediction_tokens": 0, "rejected_prediction_tokens": 0}}, "system_fingerprint": "fp_159d8341cc"}}, "error": null}

This disclosure is crucial for understanding how ABB, a multinational corporation, manages its tax responsibilities worldwide.\n\n1. **Disclosure Details**:\n   - **Scope**: It requires a list of all jurisdictions where ABB entities are tax residents, as reflected in their audited consolidated statements or publicly filed financial information.\n   - **Metrics for Each Jurisdiction**: The table outlines several specific metrics to be reported for each jurisdiction:\n     - **Entities' Names**: Lists the names of the resident entities operating in each jurisdiction.\n     - **Business Activities**: Describes the primary activities of the entities.\n     - **Employee Count**: Reports the number of employees, along with the basis for this calculation.\n     - **Financial Data**: Provides figures on revenues from both third-party sales and intra-group transactions, profit/loss before tax, and tangible assets excluding cash.\n     - **Tax Information**: Includes details on corporate income tax paid on a cash basis, corporate income tax accrued, and any discrepancies in tax accrual based on statutory rates.\n     - **Temporal Coverage**: Indicates the time period for which the information is reported.\n\n2. **Confidentiality Constraints**:\n   - **Limitation**: Due to confidentiality constraints, detailed tax information per jurisdiction is not publicly disclosed. This is a common practice, as detailed financial data at such a granular level can be sensitive and is sometimes restricted by confidentiality agreements or legal privileges.\n\nThis structure and content reflect ABB's commitment to transparent and comprehensive sustainability reporting, while also balancing the need for confidentiality regarding sensitive financial data. The disclosure is a part of the organization's compliance with the Global Reporting Initiative (GRI) standards, which aim to provide clarity and accountability in corporate financial and sustainability practices.", "refusal": null}, "logprobs": null, "finish_reason": "stop"}], "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 1717, "completion_tokens": 730, "total_tokens": 2447, "prompt_tokens_details": {"cached_tokens": 0, "audio_tokens": 0}, "completion_tokens_details": {"reasoning_tokens": 0, "audio_tokens": 0, "accepted_prediction_tokens": 0, "rejected_prediction_tokens": 0}}, "system_fingerprint": "fp_159d8341cc"}}, "error": null}

The table specifically focuses on the discrepancy in benefits provided to full-time versus temporary or part-time employees, with a notable emphasis on stock ownership opportunities. ABB highlights that while all employees (permanent full-time and part-time) have equal opportunities in stock ownership through programs like the Employee Share Acquisition Program (ESAP) or the Long-Term Incentive Plan (LTIP), certain benefits standard to full-time roles are not extended to temporary or part-time roles. Due to confidentiality, ABB does not disclose specific details but assures compliance with local regulatory requirements, particularly regarding access to benefits. The omission in detailed disclosure is attributed to confidentiality constraints.\n\nThe sustainability report also notes broader disclosures on energy consumption, emissions, and other employment-related metrics, providing a holistic view of ABB's compliance with sustainability and operational frameworks. ABB emphasizes adherence to regulatory requirements while acknowledging limitations in data collection and reporting in areas like global leave-related metrics.\n\n'''markdown\n| Disclosure | Location | Requirement(s) Omitted | Omission Statements Reason | Explanation |\n|------------|----------|------------------------|-----------------------------|-------------|\n| 01-2       | Benefits provided to full-time employees that are not provided to temporary or part-time employees | f.

The operations are managed locally, with no global and coordinated process in place. While the question of community impacts is included in the annual social reporting, it is not answered effectively, and there is a lack of process and systematic analysis of impacts, including social and environmental effects.\n\n- **Supplier Social Assessment**: The report mentions the \"Management of material topics\" in the context of supplier evaluations. Particularly, new suppliers are required to follow a registration and qualification process that includes screening based on social criteria. However, this assessment process remains somewhat opaque.\n\n- **Disclosure 3-3**: Related to the management of material topics, the report references integrity, transparency, and responsible sourcing as key challenges and priorities. However, a comprehensive approach to including and reporting this data systematically is still under development, with feasibility checks planned for upcoming periods.\n\n- **Disclosure 414-1**: \"New suppliers that were screened using social criteria\" details that all new suppliers must pass through a rigorous registration and qualification process. This process includes social criteria screening, which accounts for 54% of new suppliers.\n\nThe table illustrates the intertwined nature of ABB's commitments to sustainable operations while simultaneously highlighting the gaps in data collection, coordination, and systematic impact analysis on communities and suppliers.\n\n### Markdown Table\n\n```markdown\n| ID     | Topic                                                                    | Details                                                                                                                 | Additional Information                                                                                     |\n|--------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| 413-2  | Operations with significant actual and potential negative impacts        | Information unavailable/incomplete                                                                                      | Managed locally, global and coordinated process not available.
