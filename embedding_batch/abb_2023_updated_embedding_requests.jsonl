It is structured around two main themes: the achievement of a low-carbon society and the preservation of resources, reflecting ABB's commitment to a sustainable future.\n\nKey data points include:\n\n1. **Low-Carbon Society**: ABB aims to significantly reduce its carbon emissions. By 2030, it plans to cut its own scope 1 and scope 2 CO2e emissions by at least 80% from a 2019 baseline of 636 kilotons CO2e. As of 2023, emissions have been reduced to 151 kilotons CO2e. For scope 3 emissions, the target is a 25% reduction by 2030, starting from 76,834.2 kilotons CO2e in 2022, with the current status showing a mild decrease to 76,665.2 kilotons CO2e. Additionally, there's an ambition to avoid 600 megatons CO2e through the lifetime of products sold between 2022 and 2030, with 74 megatons CO2e avoided so far.\n\n2. **Preserving Resources**: Efforts to integrate circularity into 80% of ABB's product portfolio by 2030 are underway, with 31% achieved as of 2023. The company has also made strides in waste management, reducing waste sent to landfill, equivalent to 6.3% of total waste down from 8.8% in 2019. Finally, there's a commitment to maintaining zero harm in the workplace, aiming to cut lost time from incidents to 0.13, down from a baseline of 0.24 in 2019.\n\nThe context from the sustainability report underscores ABB's strategic focus on electrification, automation, and digitalization to drive the energy transition. The initiatives are part of a broader effort to foster resource efficiency and social progress through the ABB Way operational model.\n\n```markdown\n| Targets                                                                                  | Baseline (baseline year)                                 | 2023 status                                           |\n|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------|\n| **LOW-CARBON SOCIETY**                                                                   |                                                          |                                                       |\n| Reduce own scope 1 and 2 CO2e emissions by at least 80% by 2030 and by 100% by 2050      | 636 kilotons CO2e (adjusted for portfolio changes) 2019  | 151 kilotons CO2e                                     |\n| Reduce scope 3 CO2e emissions by 25% by 2030 and                                         | 76,834.2 kilotons CO2e (2022)                            | 76,665.2 kilotons CO2e                                |\n| by 90% by 2050                                                                           | 392,188 kilotons CO2e (2022)                             | 436,346.3 kilotons CO2e                               |\n| Ambition to avoid 600 megatons CO2e emissions throughout lifetime of products sold       | 65 megatons CO2e (2022)                                  | 74 megatons CO2e                                      |\n| from 2022 to 2030                                                                        |                                                          |                                                       |\n| **PRESERVING RESOURCES**                                                                 |                                                          |                                                       |\n| Cover at least 80% of ABB’s portfolio of products and solutions with our Circularity Approach by 2030 | na.                                                      | 31% (share of ABB’s products and solutions assessed)  |\n| Send zero waste to landfill while reducing waste generation by 2030                      | 16.8 kilotons (2019), equivalent to 8.8% of total waste   | 10.1 kilotons, equivalent to 6.3% of total waste     |\n| Zero harm to our people and contractors — we aim for a gradual reduction in lost time from incidents | 0.24 (2019)                                              | 0.13                                                  |\n```\n", "encoding_format": "float"}}

It focuses on three main aspects of sustainability goals: Trust KPI, Engagement KPI, and supply chain management.\n\n1. **Trust KPI**: This metric shows the percentage of reporters who disclosed their identity during severity level 1 and 2 investigations. The data indicates a steady rate of reporter disclosure, with 57% in 2021, which increased to and maintained at 60% in 2022 and 2023. This suggests an improvement in the transparency and trust within the organization over the years.\n\n2. **Engagement KPI**: This KPI measures the engagement levels of employees with the Integrity Awareness Portal (IAP). Starting at 25% of employees in 2021, engagement significantly increased to 69% in 2022 and reached 80% by the end of 2023. This marks a positive trend in employee involvement in integrity learnings, highlighting the effectiveness of the organization's engagement strategies.\n\n3. **Supply Chain Management**: The table also outlines the progress toward a significant target concerning high-risk suppliers in focus countries. The organization aims to cover at least 80% of its supply spending on high-risk suppliers under the Sustainable Supply Base Management (SSBM) by 2025. As of 2023, the coverage is at 42%, indicating substantial progress but also highlighting the journey ahead to meet the 2025 target.\n\nThis table is set within the broader context of the sustainability report, which discusses ABB's ambitious goals related to low-carbon initiatives, resource conservation, and social progress.

This type of assessment has proven to be particularly relevant for companies and organizations that are com- mitted to integrating sustainability considerations into their business strategies and reporting practices. The term “double materiality” refers to the two-way relationship that exists between a company and the economy, environment and society in which it operates. In other words, while the business activities of a company can have a variety of impacts on the economy, environment and society including people (impact ma- teriality), changes that occur within the economy, environment and society can also impact the activities of the company (financial materiality). ABB’s 2023 double mate- riality assessment replaces our prior materiality assessment, which was developed in 2020, to provide a more complete picture of this two-way relationship.\n\nThe assessment was guided by the following regulatory requirements and report- ing standards: the provisions of the amended Swiss Code of Obligations related to transparency on non-financial matters (Art. 964b CO), the European Sustainability Reporting Standards (ESRS), Global Reporting Initiative (GRI), Integrated Reporting Framework (IR), IFRS Sustainability Disclosure Standards, SASB Standards and recom- mendations of the Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures (TCFD).\n\n—", "encoding_format": "float"}}

It outlines ABB's commitment to reducing greenhouse gas emissions, specifically CO₂ equivalent (CO₂e) emissions, as part of its efforts toward creating a low-carbon society. The table organizes the information into targets, baseline metrics, and the present status in 2023. \n\n### Key Data Points and Trends:\n- **Scope 1 and 2 Emissions**: ABB seeks to reduce its direct (Scope 1) and energy-consumed-related (Scope 2) emissions by at least 80% by 2030 and eliminate them entirely by 2050. The baseline measurement in 2019 was 636 kilotons of CO₂e, and by 2023, this figure had reduced significantly to 151 kilotons CO₂e, demonstrating substantial progress.\n- **Scope 3 Emissions**: This scope encompasses emissions indirectly linked to ABB’s operations, such as those from purchased goods and services. The company targets a 25% reduction by 2030 and a 90% reduction by 2050, using 2022 as the baseline year, where emissions were 76,834 and 392,188 kilotons CO₂e. In 2023, emissions in this category slightly adjusted to 76,665 and 436,346 kilotons CO₂e, influenced by a change in accounting methodology and increased sales.\n- **Avoided Emissions**: ABB aims to avoid 600 megatons of CO₂e emissions from products sold between 2022 and 2030. In 2022, the contributions amounted to 65 megatons CO₂e, which increased to 74 megatons CO₂e in 2023.\n\n### Contextual Insights:\nThis table sits within a broader narrative of ABB’s dedication to energy efficiency and the integration of renewable energy solutions. The company’s carbon footprint reduction goals align with the Science Based Targets initiative (SBTi) Net-Zero Standard. The fluctuations and improvements in emissions metrics underscore the challenges and dynamic strategies ABB employs in its journey toward sustainability. By innovatively enhancing energy efficiency and emphasizing renewable energy adoption, ABB aims to maintain societal and environmental stewardship, evidenced by both substantial reductions in own operations emissions and challenges experienced in Scope 3 categories. As part of the company's strategies, two distinct scenarios, representative and strict, are used to account for changes in customer emissions, reflecting the variability in the carbon intensity of energy consumption globally.\n\n```markdown\n| Targets                                                                         | Baseline (Baseline Year)                                   | 2023 Status                                           |\n|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------|\n| **LOW-CARBON SOCIETY**                                                          |                                                            |                                                      |\n| Reduce own scope 1 and 2 CO₂e emissions by at least 80% by 2030 and fully by 2050 | 636 kilotons CO₂e (adjusted for portfolio changes) 2019    | 151 kilotons CO₂e                                    |\n| Reduce scope 3 CO₂e emissions by 25% by 2030 and by 90% by 2050                   | 76,834 kilotons CO₂e (2022) / 392,188 kilotons CO₂e (2022) | 76,665 kilotons CO₂e / 436,346 kilotons CO₂e         |\n| Ambition to avoid 600 megatons CO₂e emissions in product lifetime (2022-2030)    | 65 megatons CO₂e (2022)                                    | 74 megatons CO₂e                                     |\n```\n", "encoding_format": "float"}}

The focus is on two core areas: circularity in product and solution offerings, and waste management with an emphasis on both reducing waste generation and preventing landfill contributions.\n\nThe first target highlights the ambition to incorporate 80% of ABB's product and solution portfolio into its Circularity Approach by 2030. Despite this 2030 goal, the 2023 status shows that only 31% of the products and solutions have been assessed for circularity. This indicates a significant gap, suggesting more efforts are needed to achieve the long-term target.\n\nThe second target emphasizes the goal of sending zero waste to landfill and reducing total waste generation by 2030. As of 2023, the waste sent to landfill has reduced from a baseline of 16.8 kilotons (equivalent to 8.8% of total waste in 2019, adjusted for portfolio changes) to 10.1 kilotons, which represents 6.3% of total waste. This demonstrates notable progress in decreasing both the absolute quantity of waste and its proportion relative to total waste output.\n\nThe information within the table underscores ABB's commitment to sustainability through enhancing circularity and waste management practices, as these areas are pivotal to ABB's broader resource preservation goals. The progress made, particularly in reducing landfill waste, reflects the company's efforts in operational efficiency and environmental stewardship, although the circularity metrics indicate ongoing challenges and work required for portfolio-wide implementation.\n\n```markdown\n| Targets                                                                | Baseline (baseline year)*               | 2023 status                             |\n|-----------------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------|----------------------------------------|\n| PRESERVING RESOURCES                                                   |                                        |                                        |\n| Cover at least 80% of ABB’s portfolio                                  | n.a.                                   | 31% (share of ABB’s products and        |\n| of products and solutions with our                                     |                                        | solutions assessed)                    |\n| Circularity Approach by 2030                                           |                                        |                                        |\n| Send zero waste to landfill while reducing waste generation by 2030    | 16.8 kilotons (2019), equivalent to    | 10.1 kilotons, equivalent to           |\n|                                                                        | 8.8% of total waste (adjusted for      | 6.3% of total waste                    |\n|                                                                        | portfolio changes)                     |                                        |\n```\n", "encoding_format": "float"}}

Each target is linked to enhancing workplace safety, diversity, employee engagement, and community engagement as core components of ABB's Sustainability Agenda. The parameters measured include:\n\n- **Zero harm to personnel and contractors (Safety):** This target reflects the company's commitment to reducing lost time from incidents. From a baseline of 0.24 established in 2019, ABB achieved a reduction to 0.13 in 2023, indicating significant progress in minimizing workplace incidents and enhancing safety protocols.\n\n- **Increasing gender diversity in senior management:** By setting a target to increase the proportion of women in senior management roles to 25% by 2030, ABB aims to enhance diversity and inclusion within its leadership. From a baseline of 11.7% in 2019, the proportion increased to 21.0% by 2023, showing substantial progress towards gender parity.\n\n- **Achieving a top-tier employee engagement score:** The employee engagement score, which reflects workplace satisfaction and morale, improved from a score of 71 out of 100 in 2019 to 77 out of 100 in 2023. This indicates that ABB's efforts to foster an engaging and inclusive work environment are yielding positive results.\n\n- **Expanding community engagement programs:** ABB's initiative to broaden its community engagement programs saw significant expansions in the scope of action. These programs, which focus on education, emergency and disaster relief, community empowerment, and environmental conservation, were assessed and enhanced in 2023 as part of an improvement process that began in 2022. The baseline for this target was initially not established (n.a.).\n\nOverall, this table underscores ABB's dedication to making tangible progress in areas critical to social responsibility and sustainability. Through these targets and the reported status of each initiative, it is apparent that the company prioritizes creating a positive impact on its employees and the communities it serves.\n\n```markdown\n| Targets                                       | Baseline (baseline year) | 2023 Status                                                                                                                                                   |\n|-----------------------------------------------|--------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| **SOCIAL PROGRESS**                           |                          |                                                                                                                                                              |\n| Zero harm to our people and contractors       | 0.24 (2019)              | 0.13                                                                                                                                                         |\n| Increase proportion of women in senior management roles to 25% by 2030 | 11.7% (2019)             | 21.0%                                                                                                                                                        |\n| Achieve a top-tier employee engagement score  | 71/100 (2019)            | 77/100                                                                                                                                                       |\n| Expand programs for community engagement      | n.a.                     | As part of the improvement process started in 2022, in 2023 we assessed our community engagement positioning and revised and expanded the scope of action.   |\n|                                               |                          | Now focused on education, emergency and disaster relief, community empowerment, and environment and conservation.                                            |\n```", "encoding_format": "float"}}

The benefits focus groups we held with ABB employees in the first quarter of 2022 and 2023 revealed that our people wanted to understand their benefits better and be able to locate related information more easily.

The group drafted a proposal for the new community engagement framework, which was then revised in a cross-business area and cross-country workshop hosted by ABB in Italy. At the workshop, representatives from our 10 most active countries in the field of community engagement discussed the role ABB should play in society and pro- posed an ideal community engagement strategy and governance model for the Group. The framework will be revised in 2024.\n\nThe output from this workshop laid the foundation for a harmonized approach that is more capable of identifying community needs and better positioned to implement effective development initiatives.

Any abuse of power or trust for private gain is a breach of our ethical standards and Code of Conduct, and has no place at ABB. We know that having an adaptive anti-bribery and corruption (ABAC) program, which anticipates and meets risks head-on, is critical for ABB’s orga- nizational success. During 2023, we built on the extensive and ongoing enhancements to our ABAC program and developed ABB’s new ABAC framework. It is a conceptual overview of existing key ABAC policies, procedures and controls that have been de- signed and implemented across our operations to prevent, detect and respond to key ABAC risks that we face as a global organization.\n\nTo inform how we continuously develop our ABAC program, we leveraged estab- lished processes – and developed some new ones – to perform targeted monitor- ing and testing activities throughout the year. This included testing risk scenarios in key jurisdictions, assessing the extent of implementation of enhanced policies, procedures and controls, and developing and monitoring data-driven dashboards fed by primary enterprise tools used for day-to-day business. Through this, we have identified key ABAC risks in our operations, which we are addressing through various organization-wide initiatives, including targeted face-to-face and online training of our most at-risk employees.", "encoding_format": "float"}}

In our 2030 Sustainability Agenda, launched in 2020, we measure our progress on scope 1 and 2 against a 2019 baseline, which is adjusted to portfolio changes. The adjusted 2019 baseline is 636 kilotons.\n\nThe results are provided for comparison below:", "encoding_format": "float"}}

The table compares the emissions calculated using two different methods: market-based and location-based approaches, providing the results in kilotons of CO₂ equivalent emissions.\n\n- **Market-based Emissions:** As per this method, ABB's Scope 2 GHG emissions are significantly lower, measuring 12.9 kilotons of CO₂e. This approach accounts for the specific emission rates from the electricity suppliers ABB contracts with, often reflecting green power purchases and other contractual instruments.\n\n- **Location-based Emissions:** Here, the emissions are substantially higher, at 285 kilotons of CO₂e. This method uses an average grid emissions factor and does not take into account ABB's specific green energy purchases or contracts, but rather reflects the average emissions intensity of the electricity grid in the regions where ABB operates.\n\nThis bifurcation highlights how accounting methodologies can significantly alter reported emissions figures, emphasizing ABB's strategic moves towards lower emissions through market-based methods, which align with their sustainability goals. This also reflects ABB's efforts to maximize the use of cleaner energy sources, further supporting their 2030 Sustainability Agenda for reducing GHG emissions.\n\nThe data demonstrates ABB's commitment to sustainability and responsible energy consumption practices. The difference between the two approaches underscores the importance of accurate accounting methods in reflecting a company's true environmental impact.\n\n```markdown\n| Calculative Method | Scope 2 GHG Emissions (Kilotons CO₂e) |\n|--------------------|----------------------------------------|\n| Market-based       | 12.9                                   |\n| Location-based     | 285                                    |\n```\n", "encoding_format": "float"}}

Our calculation uses secondary data, apply- ing spend data (covering 100% of ABB’s procurement) and global industry average emission factors per material consumed from life cycle inventory databases. In the category “business travel,” emissions from air travel are calculated using emission fac- tors, with radiative forcing (RF). For the category “use of sold products,” we calculated the emissions due to losses in equipment such as drives, switches, switchgear and breakers during conduction, conversion, and transformation of electricity through our products. For products with a direct energy use, like motors and industrial robots, we calculated the emissions due to the electricity-use during the product’s service life.

The focus is on direct (Scope 1) GHG emissions, measured in kilotons of CO₂ equivalent. Scope 1 emissions are those that result directly from the operations of the company, such as the combustion of fuels, refrigerant losses (coolants), and company-owned transportation.\n\nKey data points from the table are:\n\n- **Use of Fuels**: This represents a significant portion of direct emissions, increasing from 70 kilotons in the previous measurement period to 81 kilotons.\n- **Coolants**: These emissions are documented for the latest period at 4.3 kilotons, with no data provided for the previous period.\n- **SFe**: Emissions are given for the latest period at 20 kilotons; missing data indicates potential previous non-existence or underreporting.\n- **Transport by Own Fleet**: Emissions have grown from 44 kilotons to 48 kilotons.\n- **Total Scope 1 GHG Emissions**: A summation of the direct emissions components, which shows a growth from 128 kilotons to 155 kilotons, indicating an increase in direct emissions.\n- **Biogenic CO₂ Emissions**: These emissions, distinct due to their biogenic origin, have decreased slightly from 0.86 kilotons to 0.72 kilotons.\n\nThe increase in emissions across most categories is an essential insight suggesting that while ABB is conducting operations that contribute to direct emissions, there is a need to manage and possibly mitigate this growth through technological improvements, operational efficiencies, or greener alternatives.\n\nAdditional context from the sustainability report implies that stakeholder engagement and addressing emissions are crucial for ABB's sustainability goals. They suggest that such data drive partnerships, improving the supply chain, and focusing on research and sustainable practices to enhance ABB's impact on society and their reputation while fostering growth opportunities.\n\n```markdown\n| Category                        | Previous Period (Kilotons CO₂e) | Latest Period (Kilotons CO₂e) |\n|---------------------------------|---------------------------------|-------------------------------|\n| Use of fuels                    | 70                              | 81                            |\n| Coolants                        | -                               | 4.3                           |\n| SF₆                             | -                               | 20                            |\n| Transport by own fleet          | 44                              | 48                            |\n| **Total scope 1 GHG emissions** | **128**                         | **155**                       |\n| OTHER                           |                                 |                               |\n| Biogenic CO₂ emissions          | 0.86                            | 0.72                          |\n```\n", "encoding_format": "float"}}

Also evident is the stability in male turnover, staying constant at 15% from one year to the next, while female turnover saw a slight increase.\n\nIn terms of employee hires, there's a decline noted in all regions from 2022 to 2023, suggesting a cautious hiring strategy after an initially high intake. Furthermore, the number of hires also saw a distinct decrease between the genders, highlighting changes in recruitment focus or success.\n\nThe report addresses safety performance, with no work-related fatalities reported for both years, a positive yet pivotal indicator of their ongoing commitment to employee safety. The one business travel-related fatality in 2023, compared to none the previous year, might suggest areas needing further analysis and action.\n\nOverall, this detailed table provides insight into ABB's human resource management and safety strategies, which are informative for stakeholders concerned with corporate social responsibility and employee welfare.\n\n```markdown\n| Category                                       | 2022 Headcount and (%) | 2023 Headcount and (%) |\n|------------------------------------------------|------------------------|------------------------|\n| **Employee Turnover**                          |                        |                        |\n| Turnover of All Employees by Region            |                        |                        |\n| Europe                                         | 6,852 (13%)            | 7,032 (14%)            |\n| The Americas                                   | 5,107 (19%)            | 5,726 (22%)            |\n| Asia, Middle East and Africa                   | 4,472 (14%)            | 4,438 (15%)            |\n| Turnover of All Employees by Gender            |                        |                        |\n| Female                                         | 4,817 (16%)            | 5,375 (18%)            |\n| Male                                           | 11,614 (15%)           | 11,821 (15%)           |\n| **Total Employee Turnover: ABB Group**         | 16,431 (15%)           | 17,196 (16%)           |\n|                                                |                        |                        |\n| **Employee Hires**                             |                        |                        |\n| Employee Hires by Region                       |                        |                        |\n| Europe                                         | 7,909 (15%)            | 6,068 (12%)            |\n| The Americas                                   | 6,543 (25%)            | 4,466 (17%)            |\n| Asia, Middle East and Africa                   | 5,783 (18%)            | 5,087 (17%)            |\n| Employee Hires by Gender                       |                        |                        |\n| Female                                         | 6,047 (20%)            | 4,983 (17%)            |\n| Male                                           | 14,188 (18%)           | 10,638 (14%)           |\n| **Total Employee Hires: ABB Group**            | 20,235 (18%)           | 15,621 (15%)           |\n|                                                |                        |                        |\n| **Work-Related Injuries**                      |                        |                        |\n| Employee Work-Related Fatalities               | 0                      | 0                      |\n| Incident Rate                                  | Not listed             | Not listed             |\n| Employee Business Travel Fatalities            | 0                      | 1                      |\n| Incident Rate                                  | Not listed             | 0.001                  |\n```\n", "encoding_format": "float"}}

It is specifically focused on the reporting of hazards and the average hours of training provided to employees. Here are the main insights from the table:\n\n- **Hazards Reported and Reporting Rate:** The number of hazards reported has decreased slightly from 256,513 in 2022 to 250,741 in 2023. Correspondingly, the hazards reporting rate has also decreased marginally from 2.23 in 2022 to 2.18 in 2023. This metric provides insight into the organization's safety culture and the effectiveness of its incident reporting systems.\n\n- **Average Hours of Training per Year per Employee:** Although the specific values for average training hours in 2022 and 2023 are missing from the table, this metric is important for understanding the organization's commitment to employee development and maintaining a skilled workforce. It is worth noting from the full text provided that average training hours per employee, especially by gender, are listed separately, indicating a broader focus on training programs that may not be captured in this specific section.\n\nIn the broader context of the sustainability report, these metrics would highlight ABB's efforts to maintain safety in the workplace while ensuring continuous learning and development opportunities for its employees. The decrease in hazards reported might indicate improved safety measures, but it would be prudent to investigate whether there have been changes in the reporting procedures or criteria.\n\n```markdown\n| Metric                                   | 2022      | 2023      |\n|------------------------------------------|-----------|-----------|\n| Hazards reported?                        | 256,513   | 250,741   |\n| Hazards reporting rate2®                 | 2.23      | 2.18      |\n| AVERAGE HOURS OF TRAINING PER YEAR PER EMPLOYEE |           |           |\n```\n\nIn summary, the table sheds light on the performance of ABB in terms of workplace safety and employee training, which are critical components of its sustainability initiatives.", "encoding_format": "float"}}

The data offers a comparison mainly between the years 2023 and 2022, highlighting percentages of employees in different categories and genders receiving regular performance and career development reviews. There are also figures on incidents of discrimination and harassment, as well as the company's stance on political contributions.\n\nKey Data Points and Trends:\n- In 2023, 100% of top and senior managers received regular performance reviews, which is a 2% improvement compared to 2022.\n- 99% of middle and lower managers received performance reviews in 2023, which is an increase of 4% from the previous year.\n- There was a significant increase in the percentage of other employees receiving reviews, rising from 85% in 2022 to 98% in 2023.\n- When reviewing performance metrics by gender in 2023, 64% of female and 69% of male employees received performance reviews. However, there’s no data available for gender-specific reviews in 2022.\n- The total workforce receiving performance reviews decreased from 92% in 2022 to 68% in 2023.\n- There were 17 reported incidents of discrimination and 72 incidents of harassment in 2023, which show increases from 10 and 64 respectively in 2022.\n- The company reported making no financial or in-kind political contributions in either 2023 or the previously reported period.\n\nThrough these KPIs, we see a broader commitment to providing more comprehensive performance evaluations across different employee categories. However, it appears there is a decline in coverage when viewed as an aggregate of the total workforce, particularly when divided by gender. Additionally, there is an apparent commitment to maintaining political neutrality through zero contributions, which might be indicative of a strategy focused on minimizing potential external influences. The rise in reported incidents may prompt further investigation or initiatives to improve workplace environments.\n\n```markdown\n| Indicator Description                                         | Limited Assurance 2023 | 2023 | 2022 |\n|---------------------------------------------------------------|------------------------|------|------|\n| **PERCENTAGE OF EMPLOYEES RECEIVING REGULAR PERFORMANCE**     |                        |      |      |\n| **AND CAREER DEVELOPMENT REVIEWS BY EMPLOYEE CATEGORY**       |                        |      |      |\n| Top and senior managers                                       |                        | 100% | 98%  |\n| Middle and lower managers                                     |                        | 99%  | 95%  |\n| Other employees                                               |                        | 98%  | 85%  |\n| **PERCENTAGE OF EMPLOYEES RECEIVING REGULAR PERFORMANCE**     |                        |      |      |\n| **AND CAREER DEVELOPMENT REVIEWS BY GENDER**                  |                        |      |      |\n| Female                                                        |                        | 64%  | n.a. |\n| Male                                                          |                        | 69%  | n.a. |\n| Total workforce                                               |                        | 68%  | 92%  |\n| **INCIDENTS OF DISCRIMINATION AND CORRECTIVE ACTIONS TAKEN**  |                        |      |      |\n| Total number of incidents of discrimination                   |                        | 17   | 10   |\n| Total number of incidents of harassment                       |                        | 72   | 64   |\n| **POLITICAL CONTRIBUTIONS**                                   |                        |      |      |\n| Financial and in-kind political contributions                 |                        | 0    | 0    |\n```\n", "encoding_format": "float"}}

The table includes details on where these disclosures can be found, any omitted requirements as per ABB's internal guidelines, reasons for omissions, and explanations for missing or incomplete data.\n\nKey Points:\n- **Process to Determine Remuneration:** This is disclosed in the \"Compensation Report 2023.\" There are no specific omissions or explanation notes attached, signifying full disclosure in this area.\n\n- **Annual Total Compensation Ratio:** This disclosure also refers to the \"Compensation Report 2023.\" It highlights an omission under requirement 'b', which suggests reporting the percentage increase in compensation for the highest-paid individual compared to the median increase for all other employees. This information is unavailable because the ratio was not calculated at the time of the report. The explanation indicates that this will be addressed in the 2024 report, reflecting a forward-looking commitment to improving reporting transparency.\n\nThis table highlights ABB's ongoing efforts to improve reporting accuracy and fulfill compliance standards while acknowledging current gaps and setting future goals.\n\n```markdown\n| Disclosure                     | Location                    | ABB Requirement(s) omitted                                                                                                         | Omission Statements Reason                 | Explanation                                                                                                                                      |\n|--------------------------------|-----------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Process to determine remuneration | + Compensation Report 2023  |                                                                                                                                    |                                           |                                                                                                                                                  |\n| Annual total compensation ratio| + Compensation Report 2023  | b. report the ratio of the percentage increase in annual total compensation for the organization's highest-paid individual to the median percentage increase in annual total compensation for all employees (excluding the highest-paid individual)  | Information unavailable/ incomplete      | We didn’t calculate the ratio prior to the disclosure in the 2023 report, therefore we cannot report on the percentage increase of the ratio.

However, ABB has marked this disclosure as \"Not applicable\" due to the financial assistance not being material enough to warrant disclosure. There is a clarification that the assistance, if material, would require disclosure, but it currently does not apply to ABB. ABB also mentions that there is no obligation to disclose assistance by country, which aligns with their non-disclosure.\n\n- **Management of Material Topics (Requirement 3)**: This requirement references the ABB Financial Report 2023 under the management overview section. The table lacks specific details on this point likely because there's no additional explanation provided in the excerpt.\n\nThe table suggests ABB's discretion in sustainability reporting, indicating areas where disclosures are not made due to immateriality or confidentiality constraints.

This table is essential for understanding the transparency and decision-making process ABB follows regarding its sustainability reporting.\n\nThe table highlights the complexity and sensitivity of global operations, displaying that not all data can be or is required to be aggregated at a global level. There are several instances noted where information is withheld due to confidentiality constraints, legal privilege, or lack of materiality at the Group level. \n\nKey points from the table:\n- ABB has not disclosed certain data related to government due to its insignificance to the organization.\n- Some data, like the proportion of senior management, is being considered for future collection and potential reporting.\n- Various legal, confidentiality, and data sensitivity concerns lead to the non-disclosure of specific commercial details.\n- There is a sustained effort from ABB to evaluate these omissions continuously as regulatory and operational frameworks evolve.\n\nThe content signifies ABB's approach to balancing compliance, confidentiality, and materiality in its global operations.\n\n```markdown\n| Requirement(s) omitted | Reason                             | Explanation                                                                                          |\n|------------------------|------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Government disclosures | Not material to ABB                | The requirement is deemed not significant enough to be disclosed for ABB's operations.               |\n| HR regional split data | Not consolidated at Group level    | Due to the high volume of country requirements, storing all at corporate level is not required.      |\n| Reporting on senior management proportions | Not reported globally  | While not currently collected, ABB is assessing the feasibility of tracking this information.         |\n| Energy consumption breakdown | Not distinctly categorized   | The requirement to separate energy types is evaluated as non-essential per the ABB Circularity framework. |\n| Tax information by country | Confidentiality constraints     | Sensitive commercial data is protected to maintain confidentiality and legal privilege.              |\n```\n", "encoding_format": "float"}}

While the question of community impacts is included in the annual social reporting, it is not answered effectively, and there is a lack of process and systematic analysis of impacts, including social and environmental effects.\n\n- **Supplier Social Assessment**: The report mentions the \"Management of material topics\" in the context of supplier evaluations. Particularly, new suppliers are required to follow a registration and qualification process that includes screening based on social criteria. However, this assessment process remains somewhat opaque.\n\n- **Disclosure 3-3**: Related to the management of material topics, the report references integrity, transparency, and responsible sourcing as key challenges and priorities. However, a comprehensive approach to including and reporting this data systematically is still under development, with feasibility checks planned for upcoming periods.\n\n- **Disclosure 414-1**: \"New suppliers that were screened using social criteria\" details that all new suppliers must pass through a rigorous registration and qualification process. This process includes social criteria screening, which accounts for 54% of new suppliers.\n\nThe table illustrates the intertwined nature of ABB's commitments to sustainable operations while simultaneously highlighting the gaps in data collection, coordination, and systematic impact analysis on communities and suppliers.\n\n### Markdown Table\n\n```markdown\n| ID     | Topic                                                                    | Details                                                                                                                 | Additional Information                                                                                     |\n|--------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| 413-2  | Operations with significant actual and potential negative impacts        | Information unavailable/incomplete                                                                                      | Managed locally, global and coordinated process not available.

This activity is associated with the \"Motion\" category, which suggests it is part of or relevant to the same business division that handles the preparation for re-use.\n\nThe context provided in the table identifies these activities as part of ABB's strategies contributing to climate change mitigation and supports the transition to a circular economy. This aligns with ABB's broader sustainability efforts reported in 2023, focusing on qualifying activities under the EU Taxonomy.\n\n```markdown\n| Economic Activity                                           | Description                                                                                                     | Application to ABB |\n|-------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------|\n| 5.3 Preparation for re-use of end-of-life products and components | Preparation for re-use of products and components at the end of life                                           | + Motion           |\n| 5.4 Sale of second-hand goods                               | Sale of second-hand goods that have been used for their intended purpose before by a customer, possibly after repair, refurbishment or remanufacturing | Motion            |\n```\n", "encoding_format": "float"}}

We therefore see no need for the EU Taxonomy to go beyond existing legal obligations for manufacturers.\n\nIn summary, we view the EU Taxonomy as a significant step forward in developing a common classification system for sustainable economic activities. We also under- stand how challenging this task is and that it remains a work in progress for some time in the future. At ABB, we are determined to further support the development of the EU Taxonomy, including through participation in the EU Taxonomy Stakeholder Request Mechanism, as every year of Taxonomy implementation brings a better understanding of this crucial legislation. Climate change is a global challenge that requires a global approach. The end goal should be a common global classification system for sustainable activities that is comprehensive, credible and relevant to the entire world. If the gaps in the EU Taxonomy are addressed, we believe that it has the potential to serve as a model for such a system, as well as an important driver of truly sustainable investments.\n\nABB Group Economic activities 2023 in accordance with the EU Taxonomy\n\nEu taxonomy – turnover", "encoding_format": "float"}}

This aligns with ABB's sustainability strategy, which was developed around the assessment of different climate scenarios as established by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) using Representative Concentration Pathways (RCPs). The RCPs inform the understanding of the potential impacts of climate change on ABB's operations worldwide.\n\nKey elements in the table include two main categories of risks: Acute and Chronic. Acute risks are linked to immediate threats posed by natural disasters like floods and storms, which are predicted to have a \"likely\" occurrence in the near term with a \"medium\" severity impact. These events can cause considerable damage to infrastructure and disrupt production and supply chains, which can reduce revenue. To mitigate these risks, ABB has a comprehensive emergency response plan, regular maintenance protocols, and investments in resilient infrastructure.\n\nChronic risks pertain to longer-term phenomena like increased heat and precipitation variabilities.

Carbon dioxide (CO2) makes up the vast majority of GHG emissions, but other gases, including methane (CH4), nitrous oxide (N2O) and sulfur hexafluoride (SF6), also have a warming effect. CO2, methane and nitrous oxide are released during the combustion of fossil fuels, such as coal, oil and natural gas, to produce energy. At ABB, we use the metric of CO2-equivalent (CO2e) to calculate our GHG emissions and to measure progress toward our emissions reduction targets.\n\n—\n\nScope 1 GHG emissions\n\nDirect emissions from company-owned and controlled resources, for example, emis- sions from combustion in owned or controlled boilers, furnaces, vehicles.\n\n—\n\nScope 2 GHG emissions\n\nIndirect emissions from the generation of purchased energy (electricity, steam, heat, cooling) from a utility provider.\n\n—\n\nScope 3 GHG emissions\n\nAll other indirect emissions not included in scope 1 and 2 that occur in the value chain, both upstream and downstream. According to the GHG protocol, scope 3 emissions are separated into 15 categories and include, for example, purchased goods and ser- vices, business travel and commuting, and use of sold products.\n\n—", "encoding_format": "float"}}
